For this tutorial, I will show you how to create your own blog using this template and deploy it to the internet. I will be using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as my static hosting because it is what I use for my projects. You can use any static hosting you want. (Not the best instructions I did but at least it helps you get started ðŸ˜…)

## 1. Clone this repository

You can go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lancerossdev/astro-basic-blog) of this template and click the "Use this template" button. After that, clone your forked repository on your local machine using the command below. Make sure to replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and you have the forked repository on your account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/astro-basic-blog.git
```

## 2. Install dependencies and create your content

For that, you need to install the dependencies using `npm install` (or whatever package manager you use) and open a dev server using the `npm run dev` and go to `http://localhost:3000` to your browser. After that, you can now create your content using Markdown or MDX in the `src/pages/blog` folder and also update the `blogs.ts` file. You can also change the design `src/pages/index.astro` file to your liking.

On creating a blog, create a new file ending in `.mdx` or `.md` in the `src/pages/blog` folder. Make sure to add this at the top of your file, it will serve as the metadata of your blog and also the layout it will use.

```mdx

layout: "@layouts/BlogLayout.astro" # Make sure to add this layout!
title: This is the title # The title of your blog
description: This is the description # The description of your blog
pubDate: 10/17/2022 # The date of your blog, it follows the MM/DD/YYYY format
author: Lance Ross # The author of your blog
image: "/static/image.png" # The open graph image of your blog. Add it on the /static/ folder
---
```

### Project Filepath

`public` - The public folder of your project. This is where you can add your static files like images, fonts, etc.

`assets` - The assets folder of your project. This is where you can add your open graph images and other assets that doesn't need to be shown to users.

`static` - The static folder of your project. This is where you can add your images that you want to add on your blog. Please use `.webp` format because it's just much faster than `.jpg` and `.png`.

`src` - The source folder of your project. This is where you can add your pages, components, and styles.

`components` - The components folder of your project. This is where you can add your reusable components to your pages. You can use a JavaScript Framework or Library here if you want.

`content` - The content folder of your project. This is where you update the descriptions on each blog card. I don't know how to use a cloud database so you don't need to update each blog for this so I just implemented it this way.

`pages` - The pages folder of your project. This is where you can add your pages. You can add your blog posts on the `/blog` folder using MDX or Markdown. (Yes, I forgot to include it on the picture down below ðŸ˜­)

## 3. Deploy it to the internet

After you create your content and pushed the code in your repository, you can now deploy it to the internet. I will be using Vercel for this tutorial. You can deploy it to Vercel by logging in to your Vercel account and clicking the "New Project" button. Then, you can click the "Import Project" button and select the repository you created. After that, you can click the "Deploy" button and wait for it to finish. After that, you can click the "Visit" button to see your blog! It will looks something like this that shows the "Ready" on status after you deployed it.

And there you go, you just created your blog in Astro and also deployed it to the internet. Make sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lancerossdev) for updates about me and [GitHub](https://github.com/lancerossdev) for my latest projects out there!
